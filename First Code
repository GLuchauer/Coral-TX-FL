#Resilience-Time and Climate

Climate variable (CV) - a number between 0 and 1 that increases with climate change

Resilience variable (RV) - a number betwen 0 and 1 that expresses how well corals are adapted to climate. If the RV matches the CV, corals are optimally adapted

Local and Transplanted coral (native) have better RV due to select pressure and selective breeding for changing climate

Translocated coral have lower RV due to lower selective pressure in buffered climate (deep-sea sea-mountains)

Hybrid recuits have an RV between Translocated coral and native corals

graph x = time/CV (years)
      y = population
      
Time is continuous, CV increases incrementally to model the combination of the steady increase of anthropogenic climate change and natural climate ocillation  

El Nino - occurs every 2-7 years, lasts for 9-12 months and amplies anthropogenic climate change. - for the model the CV will increase in increments of 5 years. 

#Bleaching-Population  

Number of Total coral 

Number of Bleached coral 

Number of Recover coral

Bleach Rate - a proportion of total population that bleaches due to
heat stress 

Death Rate - the proportion of bleached coral lost - all coral death will result from heat stress in model and all stressed coral bleach

Recovery Rate - the proportion of bleached coral that recover from bleaching 

Bleach = dead + recover

#change in population 

population(post) = healthy + recover
